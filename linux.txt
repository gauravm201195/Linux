owner - 7(read,write and execute)(4+2+1)
group - 5(read and execute)(4+0+1)
others - 4(read)(4+0+0)

chmod-change permissions

read bit will allow to read and list files from a directory
write bit will allow the user to create the file ,rename and delete the file in the directory

when using mv command to move from one file to another,old inode number is removed

sed
